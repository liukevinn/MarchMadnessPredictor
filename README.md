March Madness, or the postseason NCAA basketball tournament, is arguably one of the greatest postseason events over all sports. Over 10 million people spend the final weeks of March and early April watching collegiate athletes from around the country compete at the highest level. Moreover, $15.5 billion were wagered on these March Madness games in 2023. Thus, understanding the factors that contribute to a teamâ€™s success in the tournament is valuable for coaches, bettors, analysts, and basketball enthusiasts alike. In this study, we wish to develop a regression model to better predict the champions of the March Madness Tournament.
